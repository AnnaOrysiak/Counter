# Learning Time Counter

## Idea - optimal model of study and break cycle

* You can't study all the time - it's ineffective.
* Generally, studying in one-hour blocks is most effective (50 minutes of study with a ten-minute break). 
Shorter periods can be fine for studying notes and memorizing materials, but longer periods are needed for problem-solving tasks, psets, and writing papers. 

## How it's working?

1. Set the learning time (NAUKA).
2. Set the break time (PRZERWA).
3. Click on the main counter. Learning time is counting down. After each learning period there is a break.
4. You can stop and resume counting by clicking on the main counter.

** Do not spend more than an hour studying without having a break, because your brain gets tired and can’t give full attention to the subject. Make them quick breaks — just a couple minutes — so that you don’t lose your momentum. 
Just give yourself enough time to take a drink, stretch out a bit, use the bathroom, do a quick calming exercise, or something similar.
